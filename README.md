A hobby project created to read and write reviews for books. Integrates with Goodreads API which makes it possible to see the ratings average for a book.

Due to storage issues, does not contain every book but just 5000 books.

## Configuration

## Tools Used:
- Flask framework
- Templating with jinja2
- PostgreSQL
- Basic JavaScript functionality
- Bootstrap 4.1
- Basic server configuration with Heroku
- API usage with Goodreads
- API route for developers
